 ### Paper 1 - Darknet Sales
 
This paper examines the issue of illegal goods being sold on "crypto-markets" on the darknet, and proposes potential solutions for effectively combating this issue. The paper argues that increasing global collaboration amongst law enforcement organizations, and using crime scripts when planning targeted takedown operations, could be practical approaches to reduce the sale of illegal goods on the darknet. The paper provides background information on Tor, cryptomarkets, and crime scripts, and discusses the challenges law enforcement faces in tackling cryptomarket sales. The paper also suggests that using crime scripts to develop a more targeted and creative approach for law enforcement operations could be beneficial. The paper concludes by summarizing the main argument presented.
