# :books:CyberPapers 

Over the course of my unversity degree, I have written a few papers which examine various topics in Cybersecuirty. 

Have a look at the papers, and let me know what you think of the argumnents made, sources and any opposing points of view. 

Happy Reading!

 ### Paper 1 - Darknet Sales
 
This paper examines the issue of illegal goods being sold on "crypto-markets" on the darknet and suggests that increasing global collaboration amongst law enforcement organizations and leveraging crime scripts when planning targeted takedown operations could be practical approaches to reduce the sale of illegal goods on the darknet. The paper provides background knowledge on the Tor network, cryptomarkets and crime scripts, and highlights the challenges law enforcement faces when tackling cryptomarket sales. The paper also explores the need for global collaboration to improve law enforcement operations, and suggests using crime scripts to develop a more targeted and creative approach for law enforcement operations. The conclusion of the paper argues that increasing global collaboration and using crime scripts can improve the effectiveness of takedown operations for illegal goods on the darknet.
 
 ### Paper 2 - Public Wifi Security
 
This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the security implications for users when using public WiFi, and the potential risks associated with connecting to these networks. It argues that public WiFi should not be used without the use of appropriate mitigation methods, such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to protect users from malicious attacks such as rogue WiFi networks and Man in the Middle attacks. The research suggests that even though public WiFi hotspots are popular for users and beneficial for businesses, the security vulnerabilities in public WiFi network protocols require users to exercise caution when connecting to a hotspot. The paper concludes that VPNs are an effective solution for protecting users' data, as they encrypt all network data between two parties, and recommends that all users should make use of VPNs when connected to public WiFi networks.
